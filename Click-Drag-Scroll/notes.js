//working with mousedown, mouseup, mouseleave, mousemove, mouseout

//using classList.add and classList.remove to change the status of an element, in this case it was to detect whether the mouse was pressed down or not 

//one way to tell exactly where you clicked on a page is to use e.pageX, will give you the exact x-coordinates 

//capturing variables at the time of mousedown and then refrencing them when the user moves the mouse
